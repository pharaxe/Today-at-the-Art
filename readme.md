# Today at the Art
Check it out live at https://www.thearttheater.today

This project was created originally in 24 hours for Pyghack 2019.

## Inspiration
The Art Theater has been providing Champaign-Urbana residents with quality and varied entertainment for over a century. Its historic prowess is unmatched, yet it seems maybe Chambana residents are unaware of its presence.
